## This ode will install and use the following packages: data.table, reshape2, and DT.
## It then goes through and pulls all the labels, and data together, while only grabbing the means and standard deviations of the variables.
## Once it pulls it all in, it combines the two sets into one.
## Test and Train added together to become what I save as tidy_dataset.txt
## It will then save the file display the table.
